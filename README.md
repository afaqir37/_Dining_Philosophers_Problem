# Dining philosophers problem
The Dining Philosophers problem is a classic OS problem thatâ€™s usually stated in very non-OS terms:
There are N philosphers sitting around a circular table eating spaghetti and discussing philosphy.
The problem is that each philosopher needs 2 forks to eat, and there are only N forks, one
between each 2 philosophers. 
##
Design an algorithm that the philosophers can follow that
insures that none starves as long as each philosopher eventually stops eating, and such that the
maximum number of philosophers can eat at once.

Why describe problems this way? Well, the analogous situations in computers are sometimes so
technical that they obscure creative thought. Thinking about philosophers makes it easier to think
abstractly. And many of the early students of this field were theoreticians who like abstract problems.
